# TODOs

## Hatching algorithm focus

- [ ] Acute-angle cleanup pass for serpentine fills so skinny polygon tips get stitched without ink gaps.
- [ ] Add cross-hatching as a second-pass option that respects palette/layer counts.
- [ ] Add contour-following hatching that hugs polygon perimeters.
- [ ] Add stippling/pointillism mode with density tied to palette layers.
- [ ] Add user-facing controls for hatching angle and spacing density.
- [ ] Ship a hatched-circles study drawing to ensure round geometry shares the same serpentine improvements as polygons.

## Drawing gallery focus

- [ ] Establish a minimal core gallery: keep only perfect rectangle, photo mosaic, Voronoi, and implicit line walkers (line study) while disabling the rest to concentrate on hatch quality.
- [ ] Rename the remaining drawing modules/files so their titles match the new core subjects for clarity in manifests and UI.
